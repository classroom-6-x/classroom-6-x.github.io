		<meta name="description" content="Scott Cawthon developed and produced the survival horror video game Five Nights at Freddys 2 (FNAF 2). It serves as a precursor to the first and second installments of the Five Nights at Freddys franchise. The game, based in the fictional Freddy Fazbears Pizza restaurant, casts the player as a security guard working the night shift.

In FNAF 2, the player must endure five in-game nights while being pursued by animatronic creatures. The gameplay is comparable to that of the original game. The game now includes new animatronics such as Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, and Toy Freddy, as well as updated versions of the original animatronics from the previous game.

One of the main aspects of FNAF 2 is the use of a security office equipped with a range of gadgets to assist the player in surviving the night. The player can navigate the building using the ventilation system, a flashlight, and locked and unlockable doors. However, using these instruments comes at a cost because they consume energy, which must be carefully managed to survive through the night. Play FNaF 2 unblocked in Chrome or other current browsers and have fun.
