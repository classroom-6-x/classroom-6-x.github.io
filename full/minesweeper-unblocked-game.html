		<meta name="description" content="Welcome to Minesweeper, a game of the mind! Here, you can challenge yourself by attempting to complete the campaign of increasingly difficult levels, customize the game in every way, enjoy smooth animation, and learn how to play the game if youre new. The goal of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines or bombs without detonating any of them, using hints regarding the amount of adjacent mines in each area. If a mine-containing square is uncovered, the player loses the game. If no mine is disclosed, a numeral is placed in the square to indicate how many adjacent squares contain mines; if no mines are adjacent, the square is blank, and all neighboring squares are revealed recursively. The player utilizes this information to extrapolate the contents of other squares, which he can either safely reveal or designate as holding a mine. Remember, any ship can be a minesweeper once.
